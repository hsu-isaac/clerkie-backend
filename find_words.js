/* 
 * This program should find all words from a dictionary in a grid of letters. Words
 * can be matched in any direction (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
 * For example, if passed the dictionary {"CAT", "DOG", "BIRD", "PLANE"}, the program
 * should return the set {"CAT", "DOG"}. 
 * 
 * 	    |  C  |  C  |  C  |
 *      |  C  |  A  |  C  |
 *      |  C  |  C  |  T  |
 * 		|  D  |  O  |  G  |
 * 
 * Your task is to implement the main function and any other functions you may need to
 * complete the task. In addition to functionality, you'll be assessed on code efficiency,
 * overall structure/code decomposition, and error handling.
